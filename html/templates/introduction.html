<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>TPMs are remarkable! They are passive, low-end devices that offer <b>strong security guarantees.</b></p>

<p>TPM is a discrete device soldered on the motherboard. It is a cheap (costs less
  than a dollar to manufacture), <b>low-end device</b> that communicates with the
  main CPU over a <b>slow, low-bandwidth</b> channel.
</p>
<p>
  TPM is a <b>passive</b> device: it doesn't monitor the system and it can't halt
  CPU execution. For it to work, it must be fed data.
</p>
<p>
  TPM has <b>limited storage</b> for runtime state and persistent data: its non-volatile
  storage is about 64KB in size. TPM can only hold a limited number of objects
  at the same time. For this reason, a dedicated software layer on the host (resource
  manager) loads and unloads session objects at runtime.
</p>
<p>
  TPM command execution is single-threaded: it executes <b>one command at a time</b>.
  Commands cannot be queued or batched together - each command must wait for the
  currently running command to finish. Note that command execution can be canceled.
