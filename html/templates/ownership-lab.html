<h2>Taking Ownership</h2>
<p>
  <br> It's good practice to perform this setup step in a <b>clean environment</b>  (OS booted from CD, host is not connected to the network).

  <br> The process includes the following steps:

  <ol>
    <li>Read and <a class="self" href="#pg_certificates">validate</a> the EK certificate.
      Proceed only if you trust the vendor.</li>

    <li>Clear the owner hierarchy with <code>TPM2_CC_Clear</code>.</li>

    <li>Create a primary, restricted asymmetric encryption key on the owner hierarchy
      (
      <code>TPM2_CC_CreatePrimary</code>).
      <br>Call this the <em>SRK</em>.
    </li>

    <li>Certify the SRK with your enterprise CA: create a Certificate Signing Request
      (CSR) with SRKpub, and ask your internal, trusted CA to sign it. Store the
      certificate in NV data (<code>TPM2_CC_NV_DefineSpace</code>, <code>TPM2_CC_NV_Write</code>).
      <br> Alternatively, you can store the SRK public key in a remote database.
      Use this database to verify the SRK's authenticity in the future.
    </li>

    <li>Make the SRK persistent by evicting it to NVDATA (<code>TPM2_CC_EvitControl</code>).</li>

    <li>Create a restricted asymmetric signing key <b>under the SRK</b> (<code>TPM2_CC_Create</code>,
      <code>TPM2_CC_Load</code>).
      <br>Call this the <em>AIK</em>.
    </li>

    <li>Certify the AIK with your enterprise CA: create a Certificate Signing Request
      (CSR) with AIKpub, and ask your internal, trusted CA to sign it. Store the
      certificate in NV data (<code>TPM2_CC_NV_DefineSpace</code>, <code>TPM2_CC_NV_Write</code>).
      <br> Alternatively, you can store the AIK public key in a remote database.
      Use this database to verify the AIK's authenticity in the future.
      <br> It's possible to use the SRK-cert as root of trust for the AIK, however,
      having an AIKcert can simplify some workflows.
    </li>

    <li>Make the AIK persistent by evicting it to NVDATA (<code>TPM2_CC_EvitControl</code>).</li>

  </ol>

  <br> Please note, these keys should be set as fixed (non-duplicable): use
  <code>TPMA_OBJECT_FIXEDTPM</code> and <code>TPMA_OBJECT_FIXEDPARENT</code> in
  the objectAttributes field in their templates.
